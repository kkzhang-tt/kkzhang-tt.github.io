<h2 id="a-private-conversation">A Private Conversation</h2>

<p>Last week I went to the theatre. I had a very good seat. The play was very interesting. I did not enjoy it. A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. They were talking loudly. I got very angry. I could not hear the actors. I turned round. I looked at the man and the woman angrily. They did not pay any attention. In the end, I could not bear it. I turned round again. “I could not hear a word” I sad angrily.</p>

<p>“It is none of your business,” the young man said rudely. “This is a private conversation.”</p>

<h2 id="breakfast-or-lunch">Breakfast or lunch?</h2>

<p>It was Sunday. I never get up early on Sundays. I sometimes stay in bed until lunchtime. Last Sunday I got up very late. I looked out of the window. It was dark outside. “What a day!” I thought. “It is raining again.” Just then, the telephone rang. It was my aunt, Lucy. “I have arrived by train,” she said. “I am coming to see you.”</p>

<p>“But I am still having breakfast.” I said.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I am having breakfast.” I repeated.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” she said. “Do you always get up so late? It is one o`clock.”</p>

<h2 id="please-send-me-a-card">Please send me a card</h2>

<p>Postcards always spoil my holiday. Last summer, I went to Italy. I visited museums and sat in public gardens. A friendly waiter taught me a few words of Italian. Then he lent me a book. I read a few lines, but I did not understand a word. Every day I thought about postcards. My holiday passed quickly, but I did not send cards to my friends. On the last day, I made a big decision. I got  up early and bought thirty-seven cards. I spent the whole day in my room, but I did not write a single card!</p>

<h2 id="notes-2">Notes</h2>

<p>spoil(spoiled or spoilt) vt. 使索然无味，损坏</p>

<p>a few words // 几句话</p>

<p>lent me a book// lend sb sth or lend sth to sb, borrow sth or borrow sth from sb</p>

<h2 id="comprehension-2">Comprehension</h2>

<ul>
  <li>He lent me a book.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>英语中有些动词可以带两个宾语，这些动词大都具有“给予”的含义。 如 He lent me a book. 中，动词 lent 后面带有表示动作结果的直接宾语（a book）和表示动作目标的间接宾语（me）。 间接宾语在大多数情况下置于直接宾语之前，如果间接宾语在后，则间接宾语前必须加“to”（表示动作对什么人而做）或“for”（表示动作为什么人而做）</p>
