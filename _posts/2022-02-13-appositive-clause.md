## 1-同位语

一个名词（或其它形式）***对另一个名词或代词进行解释或补充说明***，这个名词（或其它形式）就是同位语。

同位语与被它限定的词的格式要一致，并常常紧挨在一起。同位语除表示其同位成分的全部意义外，还可以表示部分意义。

- Mr. Smith, our new teacher, is very kind to us.
- He told me that his brother John was a world-famous doctor.(John 是 brother 的同位语)
- Yesterday I talked to my English teacher, Mr. James.

- He is interested in sports, especially ball games.(ball games 是 sports 的同位语)
