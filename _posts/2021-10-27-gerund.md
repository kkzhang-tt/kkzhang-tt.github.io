# 1. 介绍

动名词是由动词变化而来，一方面保留着动词的某些特征，具有动词的某些变化形式，用以表达名词所不能表达的较为复杂的意念；另一方面动名词在句子的用法及功能与名词类同: 在句子中可以作主语、宾语、表语、定语，它也可以被副词修饰或者用来支配宾语。

> 既有动词的变化形式，又具有名词的用法

# 2. 用法

## 2.1 主语

动名词做主语，**谓语动词用单数**。

1. **直接位于句首做主语**

   - Swimming is a good sport in summer.
   - Fighting broke out between the South and the North.
   - Breathing became difficult at that altitude.

2. **用 it 作形式主语**，把**动名词**(真实主语)**置于句尾作后置主语**

   > 动名词做主语时，不太常用 it 作先行主语，多见于某些形容词及名词之后。常见的能用于这种结构的形容词还有：good，better，wonderful, enjoyable，interesting，foolish，difficult，useless，senseless，worthwhile，等。但是 important，essential，necessary 等形容词不能用于上述结构。

   - It is no use waiting for him any longer.
   - It is no good learning without practice.
   - It is dangerous using this method to measure the speed of light.
   - It is worthwhile consulting your tutor about it again.

3. 用于 "**There be" 结构**中

   - There is no saying when he'll come. 很难说他何时回来
   - There is no joking about such matters.

4. 用于**布告形式的省略结构**中

   - No smoking. =  Smoking is not allowed here.
   - No parking.  = parking is not allowed here.

5. 动名词的复合结构作主语

   > 当动名词有自己的逻辑主语时，常可以在前面加上一个**名词或代词的所有格**，构成动名词的复合结构(此时，名词或代词的所有格做动名词的逻辑主语)。

   - His coming to help was a great encouragement to us.

## 2.2 定语

1. 动名词一般为名词性，很少做定语，不过在一些特殊的情况下可以用来表示所修饰名词的用途
   - sleeping bag
   - walking stick
   - drinking water
   - swimming pool
2. 有些动名词已经转化成了形容词，常用作定语修饰物，表示“令人……的”，如 exciting, shocking, puzzling, confusing, disappointing, discouraging, boring, tiring, moving, touching, interesting, satisfying, frightening, amazing 等
   - That must be a terrifying experience.
   - The experiment was an amazing success.

## 2.3 宾语

1. 一些动词后用动名词作宾语，如 finish 完成，enjoy享受，mind介意，suggest建议，practise练习，admit 承认，advise 建议，allow 允许，appreciate 感激，avoid 避免，consider 考虑，delay 推迟，deny 否认，discuss 讨论，dislike 不喜欢，enjoy 喜爱，escape 逃脱，excuse 原谅，fancy 设想， forbid 禁止，forgive 原谅，imagine 想像，keep 保持，mention 提及，mind 介意 miss 没赶上，pardon 原谅，permit 允许， prevent 阻止，risk 冒险，understand 理解
   - I admit breaking the window.
   - Try to imagine being on the moon.
   - He tried to escape being punished.
   - You shouldn’t keep thinking about it.
   - Would you mind going with her?
   - I can’t understand neglecting children like that.
   - We only missed seeing each other by five minutes.
2. 有些动词短语后跟动名词作宾语，如 insist on, be worth，give up，object/objection to，put off，keep on，insist on，leave off，look forward to，think of, can't help, be/get used to, spend...in ,can’t stand，feel like 等
   - Do you feel like going out for dinner with me tonight?
   - Chinese people are looking forward to holding the 27th Olympic games.
   - I am used to going to bed late and getting up late.
   - The professor was quite used to students' being late for his lecture.
   - He put off making a decision till he had more information.

## 2.4 表语

1. 动名词作表语时句子**主语常是表示无生命的事物名词或 what 引导的名词性从句**。表语动名词与主语通常是对等的关系，表示主语的内容，**主语、表语可互换位置**。

   > 如果句中的主语和表语同为动词时，要注意保持两个动词在形式上的一致。

   - Your task is cleaning the windows. = Cleaning the windows is your task.
   - What I hate most is being laughed at. = Being laughed at is what I hate most.
   - The most popular pastime is playing chess. = Playing chess is the most popular pastime.
   - The only thing that interests her is working. = Working is the only thing that interests her.
