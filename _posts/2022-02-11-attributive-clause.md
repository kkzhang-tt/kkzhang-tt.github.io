## 1-基本概念

### 1-1 定义

一个简单句跟在*名词或代词（先行词）后进行修饰限定*，就叫做定语从句；定语从句在主句中充当定语成分。

被定语从句修饰的词叫**先行词**；定语从句通常只能放在被修饰的先行词之后。

> 单词做定语放在被修饰词之前
> 

### 1-2 引导词

1. 引导定语从句的词有：
    - 关系代词：**that, who, whom, which, as**
    - 关系副词：**when, where, why**
2. 引导词位于定语从句之前，先行词之后（as 除外）。
3. 引导词的作用有：
    - 连接先行词和定语从句
    - 在定语从句中充当一定的成分（***关系代词充当主语或宾语，关系副词充当状语***）

## 2-关系代词的用法

1. **who/that** 指人，是主格；**在定语从句中代替先行词，又作定语从句的主语，不能省略**
    - Do you know the gentleman who/that is sitting there？
    - The student who/that answered the question was John.
    - Nothing is difficult to the man who/that will try.
    - The windows was broken by the boy who/that lives opposite.
2. **whom/who/that** 指人，是宾格；**在定语从句中代替先行词，又作定语从句的宾语(动宾或介宾)**
    1. 当作**动宾**（动词后接宾语）时，关系代词可省略
        - Do you know the gentleman (whom/who/that) we met just now？
        - The author (whom/who/that) you criticized.
        - Then I telephoned the doctor (whom/who/that) Charles had recommended.
    2. 当作**介宾**（介词后接宾语）时：*介词不提前，关系代词可省略；介词提前，关系代词不可省*，即 “介词+whom” (指人时介词后的关系代词只能用whom)
        - The man (whom/who/that) I spoke with is my teacher.
        - The man with whom I spoke is my teacher.
        - The man with whom I traveled couldn’t speak English
        
        固定的动词短语（动词+介词），如 look for, take care of 等不能把动词与介词拆开，即介词不能提至引导词前。
        
        - She is the right girl (who/whom/that) we are looking for.
3. **whose** 是所有格 “…的” 形式；**whose + n. 一起在定语从句中充当主语、宾语(**动宾或介宾)，即先行词的什么东西。
    
    whose 用来指人或物（只用作定语) ，且 whose 不能省略。
    
    > *whose + n. = the + n. + of which/whom*
    
    - I didn’t find the desk whose leg was broken. (主语)
    - He is the student whose pencil I broke yesterday. (动宾)
    - The boss in whose company I work is very kind. (介宾)
    - They rushed over to help the man whose car had broken down. (主语)
4. **which/that** 指物，**代替先行词，且在定语从句中作主语或宾语(动宾或介宾)**
    1. 作主语
        - The house which/that was destroyed in the earthquake is weak.
    2. 作宾语
    
        which/that 作宾语时，同样分为动宾与介宾两种情况：1. 作动宾时，which/that 可以省略；2. 作介宾时，介词不提前时，关系代词 which/that 可以省略；介词提前时，关系代词 which/that 不可以省略。
    
        - The pen (which/that) you found yesterday is mine.
        - The games (that/which) the young men competed in were difficult.
        - The games in which the young men competed were difficult.

> ***介词 + which 指物；介词 + whom 指人***

1. **as** 指人或物，在定语从句中可作主语，宾语，表语或状语，不能省略
    
    主要用于 “**the same …as…；such …as…；so …as…；as … as…；as follows** ” 固定结构中。在这种形式的结构中，要用 as 代替 who(m), which, 或 that 引导定语从句。
    
    - Such people as knew Hill thought he was honest.
    - Such people as Hill knew thought he was honest.
    - My hometown is no longer the same as it was.
    - Here is so big a stone as no one can lift.
    - The child knows as much as grow-ups (know).
    - I’d like to have the same books as are used in your school.
    - He is not such a person as I expected.
    - He will marry as pretty a girl as he can find.

## 3-关系副词的用法

关系副词，兼有副词与连接词两种作用，在**不及物动词的连接中要求用关系副词**。

关系副词在句中作状语，关系副词=介词+关系代词，定语从句中常用的关系副词有三个：**when，where，why**。

> when = during/on/in which  where = in/at/on which  why = for which
 
1. **when** 主要用于修饰表时间的名词，同时它在定语从句中用作**时间状语**
    - There comes a time when you have to make a choice.
    - Gone are the days when they could do what they liked.
    - We'll put off the picnic until next week, when the weather may be better.
    
    先行词为时间名词时不一定用关系副词 when 来引导定语从句；需要进一步判断先行词在定语从句中成分。如果在定语从句中作时间状语，则用 when；如果在定语从句中作主语或者宾语时，要用 that, which 等。
    
    - Don't forget the time (that, which) I've told you.（先行词 time 作 told 的宾语）
2. **where** 主要用于修饰表地点的名词，同时它在定语从句中用作**地点状语**
    - This is the village where he was born.
    - That's the hotel where we were staying last summer.
    - Barbary was working in Aubury, where she went daily in a bus.
    
    同样，先行词为地点的名词时，不一定要用 where 引导，需要进一步判断先行词在定语从句中的成分。
    
    - He works in a factory that/which makes TV sets.
3. **why** 主要用于修饰表原因的名词(主要是the reason)，同时它在定语从句中用作**原因状语**
    - We don't know the reason why he didn't show up.
    - She didn't tell me the reason why she refused the offer.
    
    why 与 where/when 的用法有点不同：
    
    1. **why 可以省略或者替换成 that**
        - That's one of the reasons (why, that) I asked you to come.
    2. why 只能引导限制性定语从句，where/when 可以引导非限制性定语从句
        - The main reason, why he lost his job, was that he drank. (wrong)
        - The main reason why he lost his job was that he drank. (right)

## 4-限制性与非限制性定语从句的区别

1. 在句中作用不同
    - 限制性定语从句**对**被修饰的**先行词有限定制约作用**，使该词的含义更具体,更明确。**限制性定语从句不能被省略**，否则句意就不完整。
    - 非限制性定语从句**与先行词关系不是十分密切**，只是对其作一些附加说明，不起限定制约作用。如果将非限制性定语从句省去，主句的意义仍然完整。
2. 表现形式不同
    
    限制性定语从句因与先行词关系密切，所以**不可以用逗号将其与主句隔开**；非限制性定语从句与先行词关系不是十分密切，所以**可用逗号将其与主句隔开。**
    
    - Do you remember the girl who taught us English?
    - Clock is a kind of instrument which can tell people time.
    - This is the place where he used to live.
    - Mr. Zhang, who came to see me yesterday, is an old friend of mine.
    - We walked down the village street, where they were having market day.
    
    前三个例句中，定语从句与先行词关系密切，为限制性定语从句，不可用逗号隔开；后面两个例句中，定语从句与先行词关系不密切，为非限制性定语从句。
    
3. 先行词内容有所不同
    
    大多数限制性和非限制性定语从句的先行词往往为某一个词或短语，而特殊情况下***非限制性定语从句的先行词也可为整个主句,此时非限制性定语从句常由 which 引导***。
    
    - *A middle-aged woman killed her husband*, **which** frightened me very much.
    - *A five-year-old boy can speak two foreign languages*, **which** surprises all the people present.
4. 使用的关系词有所不同
    1. that 不可以引导非限制性定语从句
        
        所有关系代词和关系副词都可以引导限制性定语从句，大部分关系代词与关系副词都可以引导非限制性定语从句，但是 that 除外。
        
        - He gave his mother a color TV set for her birthday, that pleased her a lot.（wrong）
        - He gave his mother a color TV set for her birthday, ***which*** pleased her a lot.（wright）
        - He didn't pass the exam, that disappointed me.（wrong）
        - He didn't pass the exam, ***which*** disappointed me.（wright）
    2. 关系词替代情况不同
        
        关系代词 whom 在限制性定语从句中作宾语时可用 who 代替 whom ,但 whom 在非限制性定语从句中作宾语时不可用 who 来代替。
        
        在限制性定语从句中,先行词指人时可用 that 代替 who/whom ,但在非限制性定语从句中先行词指人时, 不可用 that 代替 who/whom。
        
    3. 关系代词省略情况不同
        
        关系代词在***限制性定语从句中作宾语时可以省去***,非限制性定语从句的所有关系词均不可省。
        
        - This is the book (*which/that*) he lost yesterday.
        - The book, *which* he lost yesterday, has been found.

## 5-wich 与 that
