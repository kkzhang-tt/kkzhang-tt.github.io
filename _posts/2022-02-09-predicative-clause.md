## 1-介绍

表语从句放在连系动词之后，充当复合句中的表语。

表语从句( Predicative Clause )就是指一个**句子作为表语，说明主语是什么或者怎么样**，由名词、形容词或相当于名词或形容词的词或短语充当，和**连系动词一起构成谓语**。

## 2-构成

主语+连系动词+句子作表语(表语从句)

## 3-引导表语从句的关联词

    - The question remains whether they will be able to help us.
    - At that time，it seemed as if I couldn't think of the right word.
    - It seems to me that we should answer for this. (在我看来...)
    - It appears to her that he wants to teach us all he has. (在她看来...)
2. **从属连词 whether，as，as if / though** 引导表语从句
    - He looked just as he had looked ten years before.
    - It sounds as if someone is knocking at the door.

4. **because，why** 引导表语从句
    - That's because he didn't understand me.（强调原因；那是因为...）
    - That's why he got angry with me.（强调结果；那是为什么...）
    
    what 引导的主语从句**表示结果**或**名词 reason 作主语**时，后面的表语从句表示原因时要用 that 引导，不宜用 because.
    
    - The reason why I was sad was **that** he didn't understand me.
5. **连接代词/连接副词**引导表语从句
    
    连接代词有 : **who，whom，whose，what，which，whoever，whatever，whichever**
    
    - The problem is who we can get to replace her.
    - That was what she did this morning on reaching the attic.
    
    连接副词有：**where，when，how，why**
    
    - The question is how he did it.
6. 使用虚拟语气的表语从句
    
    在**表示建议、劝告、命令含义的名词后的表语从句，谓语动词需用 “should+动词原形” 表示**(should 可省略)。
    
    常见的词有：**advice，suggestion，order，proposal，plan，idea** 等。
    
    - My suggestion is that we (should) start early tomorrow.
