# Lesson 1

## A Private Conversation

Last week I went to the theatre. I had a very good seat. The play was very interesting. I did not enjoy it. A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. They were talking loudly. I got very angry. I could not hear the actors. I turned round. I looked at the man and the woman angrily. They did not pay any attention. In the end, I could not bear it. I turned round again. "I could not hear a word" I sad angrily.

"It is none of your business," the young man said rudely. "This is a private conversation."

## Notes

go to the theatre // 去看戏

got angry // 生气

turn around == turn round // 转身

pay attention // 注意

I could not bear it // 我无法忍受 == I could not stand it.

none of your business // 不关你的事

## Comprehension

- Last week the writer went to the theatre. He was **at** the theatre.

> 表示在某一个地方用介词 in 或 at, in 表示在大的空间，如国家，城市等，at 则表示在小的地点或空间，如at the office, at the theatre 等

- The young man and the young woman were sitting behind the him. He was sitting **in front of** them.

> ahead of (在……的前面，在……之前；领先；提前)不和 behind 对应，也不强调位置的前后顺序。 before 和 in front of 都是和 behind 对应的，都有“在……前面”的意思。但in front of 更具体的强调位置，而 before 则包含更宽泛的意思，即时间上，空间，次序，登记，重要性 方面的“在……前面”

- The writer looked at the young man and the young woman angrily. He was very **cross**.

> unhappy (不幸的，不快乐的)不一定是生气; cross (脾气坏的，易怒的，生气的)与angry 意思相同

# Lesson 2

## Breakfast or lunch?

It was Sunday. I never get up early on Sundays. I sometimes stay in bed until lunchtime. Last Sunday I got up very late. I looked out of the window. It was dark outside. "What a day!" I thought. "It is raining again." Just then, the telephone rang. It was my aunt, Lucy. "I have arrived by train," she said. "I am coming to see you."

"But I am still having breakfast." I said.

"What are you doing?" she asked.

"I am having breakfast." I repeated.

"Dear me!" she said. "Do you always get up so late? It is one o`clock."

## Notes

ring(rang, rung) v. (铃，电话等)响

on Sundays // 指每个星期日；星期几前面用介词 on

What a day! // 多么糟糕的天气！省略的感叹句，完整句子为 What a day it is! 英语中的感叹句常用 What 开头，后面紧跟一个名词或者名词性短语（包括连系动词），然后是主语 & 谓语，句尾是感叹号。

I am coming to see you.// 用现在进行时表示近期计划或者安排要进行的动作

Dear me! // 天呐！也是感叹句

## Comprehension

- It is a beautiful picture! == What a beautiful picture!

> 英语中常用 What 引导的感叹句表示惊奇，愤怒，赞赏，喜悦等情感。

- 现在完成时由“have/has+过去分词”构成，有两个含义：
  - 表示动作发生在过去，但与现在的情况有联系，有时无时间状语，有时和一些表示不确定的过去时间状语连用，如：many times，just，yet，ever，never，already，before，so far, by now等连用
  - 表示从过去某一时间开始一直延续到现在并还可能继续延续下去的动作，用于延续性动词，且句中常带有表示一段时间的时间状语，如：for two months, so far等
- 过去时表示过去某时发生的动作或单纯叙述过去的事情，强调动作

# Lesson 3

## Please send me a card

Postcards always spoil my holiday. Last summer, I went to Italy. I visited museums and sat in public gardens. A friendly waiter taught me a few words of Italian. Then he lent me a book. I read a few lines, but I did not understand a word. Every day I thought about postcards. My holiday passed quickly, but I did not send cards to my friends. On the last day, I made a big decision. I got  up early and bought thirty-seven cards. I spent the whole day in my room, but I did not write a single card!

## Notes

spoil(spoiled or spoilt) vt. 使索然无味，损坏

a few words // 几句话

lent me a book// lend sb sth or lend sth to sb, borrow sth or borrow sth from sb

## Comprehension

- He lent me a book.

> 英语中有些动词可以带两个宾语，这些动词大都具有“给予”的含义。 如 He lent me a book. 中，动词 lent 后面带有表示动作结果的直接宾语（a book）和表示动作目标的间接宾语（me）。 间接宾语在大多数情况下置于直接宾语之前，如果间接宾语在后，则间接宾语前必须加“to”（表示动作对什么人而做）或“for”（表示动作为什么人而做）

* He lent me a book. == He lent a book to me.

* He sent me a card. == He sent a card to me.

* She bought me a tie. == She bought a tie for me.

* She made me a cake. == She made a cake for me.

He has just bought an Australian car and has gone to Alice Springs, a small town in the centre of Australia. He will soon visit Darwin. From there, he will fly to Perth.

# Lesson 5

## No wrong numbers

Mr. James Scott has a garage in Silbury and now he has just bought another garage in Pinhurst. Pinhurst is only five miles from Silbury, but Mr. Scott cannot get a telephone for his new garage, so he has just bought twelve pigeons. Yesterday, a pigeon carried the first message from Pinhurst to Silbury. The bird covered the distance in three minutes. Up to now, Mr. Scott has sent a great many requests for spare parts and other urgent messages from one garage to another. In this way, he has just begun his own private 'telephone' service.

## Notes

pigeon n. 鸽子

cover v. 越过 cover the distance in three minutes

spare part 备件

from Silbury 介词 from 当作 '距 ...，离 ...' 常与 away 连用。It is far away from here.

up to now == up till now 到现在为止；作时间状语，句子时态多用于现在完成时

a great many 许多；只能同可数名词复数连用
