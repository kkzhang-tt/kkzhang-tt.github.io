# 1-介绍
状语从句指句子用作状语时, 起副词作用的句子。它可以修饰谓语、非谓语动词、定语、状语或整个句子。根据其作用可分为时间、地点、原因、条件、目的、结果、让步、方式和比较等从句。
状语从句一般由连词(从属连词)引导，也可以由词组引起。从句位于句首或句中时通常用逗号与主句隔开，位于句尾时可以不用逗号隔开。

# 2-地点状语从句
## 2-1-介绍

地点状语从句表示地点，方位，通常由 where 引导。

- He lives there. (there 做地点状语)
- He lives in Inner Mongolia. (in inner Mongolia 做地点状语)
- He lives where the climate is mild. (where ... 做地点状语从句)

## 2-2-引导词

常用引导词 **where**，特殊引导词 **wherever, anywhere, everywhere.**

| 引导词 | 含义 | 说明 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| where | 在……地方 | 通常表示一个确定的地方 |
| wherever | 无论什么地方 | 表示任何地方 |
| anywhere | 任何地方 | 表示任何地方 |
| everywhere | 到处 | 表示任何地方 |

- We must camp where we can get water.
- They will go where they are happy.
- Wherever there is political upheaval, invariably there are refugees.

## 2-3-地点状语从句与定语从句的区别

1. where 引导定语从句时，where 是关系副词，并且 **where 在从句中作地点状语**，**前面有表示地点的先行词**
    - The bookshop where I bought this book is not far from here.
    - This is the house where I lived two years ago.
    - We will start at the point where we left off.
2. where 引导状语从句时，where 是从属连词。**where 引导的从句修饰主句的谓语动词，并且 where 前面没有表示地点的先行词**
    - Wuhan lies where the Changjiang River and the Hanjiang River meet.
    - Make a mark where you have any doubts or questions.
    - I found my books where I had left them.
3. 有时 where 引导的地点状语从句兼有抽象条件含义，**可放在主句的前面**，而 where 引导的定语从句则不能
    - Where there is a will, there is a way.
    - Where there is water, there is life.
4. 在有些情况下，where 引导的定语从句可转换为 where 引导的地点状语从句
    - A tall building was put up at the place where there used to be a desert
        = A tall building was put up where there used to be a desert.
    - Bamboo grows best in places where it is warm and where it rains often.
        = Bamboo grows best where it is warm and where it rains often.

1. **名词 + as/though + 主语 + 动词**
    - King as he was, he was unhappy.

    > 

### 8-2-3 whether

由 whether 引导的让步状语从句旨在说明正反两方面的可能性都不会影响主句的意向或结果，所以***语气是比较强烈的***，从而也更加坚定了主句的内容。

### 8-2-5 even though & even if

    - Even if it rains tomorrow, we won't change our plan.
    - Even if you saw him pick up the money, you can't be sure he stole it.

    - He's the best teacher even though he has the least experience.
