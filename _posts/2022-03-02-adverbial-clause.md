# 1-介绍
状语从句指句子用作状语时, 起副词作用的句子。它可以修饰谓语、非谓语动词、定语、状语或整个句子。根据其作用可分为时间、地点、原因、条件、目的、结果、让步、方式和比较等从句。
状语从句一般由连词(从属连词)引导，也可以由词组引起。从句位于句首或句中时通常用逗号与主句隔开，位于句尾时可以不用逗号隔开。

# 2-地点状语从句
## 2-1-介绍

地点状语从句表示地点，方位，通常由 where 引导。

- He lives there. (there 做地点状语)
- He lives in Inner Mongolia. (in inner Mongolia 做地点状语)
- He lives where the climate is mild. (where ... 做地点状语从句)

## 2-2-引导词

常用引导词 **where**，特殊引导词 **wherever, anywhere, everywhere.**

| 引导词 | 含义 | 说明 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| where | 在……地方 | 通常表示一个确定的地方 |
| wherever | 无论什么地方 | 表示任何地方 |
| anywhere | 任何地方 | 表示任何地方 |
| everywhere | 到处 | 表示任何地方 |

- We must camp where we can get water.

## 2-3-地点状语从句与定语从句的区别

1. where 引导定语从句时，where 是关系副词，并且 **where 在从句中作地点状语**，**前面有表示地点的先行词**
    - The bookshop where I bought this book is not far from here.
    - This is the house where I lived two years ago.
    - We will start at the point where we left off.
2. where 引导状语从句时，where 是从属连词。**where 引导的从句修饰主句的谓语动词，并且 where 前面没有表示地点的先行词**
    - Wuhan lies where the Changjiang River and the Hanjiang River meet.
    - Make a mark where you have any doubts or questions.
    - I found my books where I had left them.

    - Where there is a will, there is a way.
    - Where there is water, there is life.
4. 在有些情况下，where 引导的定语从句可转换为 where 引导的地点状语从句
    - A tall building was put up at the place where there used to be a desert
        = A tall building was put up where there used to be a desert.
