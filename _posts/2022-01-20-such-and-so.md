such 和 so 都可以**表示程度**，含有“如此、这/那样、这/那么”的意思，但它们在用法上有一定区别。

- such 为形容词，一般**修饰名词**
- so 为副词，一般**修饰形容词或副词**

## such 用法

1. such + a/an + 可数名词单数
    - All of us have never seen ***such an animal before***.
    - He said he would rather be poor than get money ***in such a way***.
2. such + a/an + 形容词 + 可数名词单数
    - She is ***such a good teacher*** just as we expect.
    - I really thank you for giving ***such an exciting party***.
3. such + 可数名词复数
    - ***Such things*** often happen in our daily life.
    - I don’t think ***such people*** are dangerous.
4. such + 形容词 + 可数名词复数
    - He told us ***such funny stories*** that we all couldn’t help laughing.
    - He’s amazed to see ***such beautiful fishes*** under the sea.
5. such + 不可数名词
    - When he knew ***such news***, he began to cry.
    - It’s dangerous to go swimming in ***such weather***.
6. such + 形容词 + 不可数名词
    - We are glad to see that he has made ***such rapid progress*** in English this term.
    - I’ll remember ***such delicious food***.

## so 用法

1. so + 形容词/副词
    - It’s ***so cold*** outside. We’d better wear warm clothes.
    - He spoke ***so fast*** that I couldn’t follow.
2. so + 形容词 + a/an + 可数名词单数
    - He’s ***so kind a man*** that everybody here likes him.
    - It’s ***so easy an exercise*** that every one of us can do it.
    
    这种句式可以和 such + a/an + 形容词 + 可数名词单数换用：
    
    - I’ve never seen so amusing a film. = I’ve never seen such an amusing film.
3. so + many/much/few/little + 可数名词复数/不可数名词
    - There are ***so many visitors*** in our school today.
    - I have eaten ***so much food***. I don’t want to eat any more.
    
    so many 已成固定搭配，a lot of 虽相当于 many，但 a lot of 为名词性的，只能用 such 搭配。
    
    - I feel very happy that I have such a lot of friends.
